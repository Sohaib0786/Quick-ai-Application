 Project Overview (Description)
•	A complete AI-powered SaaS application built with the PERN stack:
o	PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js
•	Includes user authentication via Clerk, subscription billing, and multiple AI tools:
o	Article generator
o	Blog title creator
o	Image generation & editing
o	Resume analyzer
 Case Study | Research & Architecture
1. Tech Stack & Purpose
•	Front-end: React for UI components and state management.
•	Back-end: Node.js with Express serving REST endpoints.
•	Database: PostgreSQL to store user data, subscriptions, and generated AI content.
•	Clerk: handles secure authentication and session management.
•	Stripe or integrated billing system: manages subscription features.
•	AI integration: Likely via OpenAI or other APIs called for tasks like content or image generation.
•	Purpose: Deliver an end-to-end SaaS using AI features bundled into one app for real usage scenarios 
2. User Flows & Business Logic
•	User signup/login via Clerk.
•	Subscription onboarding and billing flows after sign-up.
•	Access to AI tools—like generating content or images—based on subscription tier.
•	Front-end communicates with back-end API routes, which in turn call AI models.

3. Key Development Phases
•	Environment setup: Code repository initialized → React client, Express server, database integrated.
•	Auth integration: Clerk components wired into UI; backend protects endpoints.
•	Paid onboarding: Stripe (or equivalent) set up to capture billing and subscription states.
•	AI tools: Routes implemented server-side to process AI tasks; React components for UI controls.
•	Database design: Tables for users, subscriptions, AI tool logs, usage history. 
4. Deployment
•	Likely deployed as a full-stack app to cloud platforms (e.g., Vercel or Heroku) with environment variables for Clerk, billing, database, and AI keys.
•	Continuous deployment pipeline from GitHub to production hosting.
5. Results & Impact
•	A fully functioning AI SaaS ready for real-world use.
•	Scalable design—with modular tools and billing integrations.
•	Quick MVP development leveraging standard stack and SaaS patterns.
